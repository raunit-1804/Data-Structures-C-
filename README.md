# Data-Structures-C-
These are some of the codes I have written in C++. I have done the implementation of many data structures - 
Trees(Binary + BST + Generic)
Hashmaps(problems + implementation)
Tries
Graphs
some popular algorithms(Dijkstra's, Prim's..)
PriorityQueues(implementation + problems)
OOPS
Cartesian Tree
